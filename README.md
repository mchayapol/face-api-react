![Sample face-api.js](https://github.com/mchayapol/face-api-react/blob/main/public/sample.png?raw=true =200x)

This app uses webcam and (face-api.js)[https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/] to detect a face and extract landmarks of the face.

face-api.js model files must be accessible publically; in this case, they are in `/public/models`.

To run
```
yarn
yarn start
```
and browse to http://localhost:3000
